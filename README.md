# meetme-calendar

## About

A fullstack application built by [@heneriknguyen](https://github.com/heneriknguyen) and I for our CSCI 446 - Web Applications capstone project. MeetMe Calendar was built with a [React](https://react.dev/) frontend, an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) backend, a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database for persistence, the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library for datetime functionality, and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling. 

The MeetMe Calendar includes a foundational set of functionality including:
- An account creation/sign-in page for new/existing users.
- The ability to create, modify, and delete events on a user's calendar.
- The ability to add other users (connections) and view their availability for meeting times.
- Basic *change password* & *delete account* features.

Other features that we wanted to include, but didn't have time to add:
- Customizable application styles (instead of the default blue theme).
- The ability to request a meeting time on a connection's calendar.
- A notification panel that shows a user's meeting requests (accepted/rejected/pending).
