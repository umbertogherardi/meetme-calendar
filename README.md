# meetme-calendar

Our final project assignment for CSCI446 - Web Applications

TODO:
- Implement add event functionality on month view
- Have events be displayed on month view
- Events should be clickable and removable/editable on month view
- Implement contacts and populate contacts list with mongoData 
    (probably as simple as a userId as the primary, then a list of other userIds as the contacts)
- Do settings stuff (mostly visual options, like changing the color of events and the today color in the calendar)
- Implement authorization & corresponding sign-in login functionalities
- Do the same logic in month view for week and day views (probably finish month view first before doing these)
